Everything on the market was excessively feminine or obnoxiously masculine, so in 2015 they started making their own jewelry to fit their own genderqueer style. One of their first pieces was the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.automicgold.com\/search?q=threader\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Automic Gold Threader\"><span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">threader<\/span><\/a>, driven by their desire to make something stylish and elevated, with good quality, sustainable materials, and without a high price tag.
