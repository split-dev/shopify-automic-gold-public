            "description": "<p>How to Check Your Gemstone Settings:<\/p><p>Bumping or dropping your jewelry, catching it on clothing, or even just normal everyday wear can cause your stone’s setting to loosen and wear down. Some metals (like gold) are softer than others and some setting types are more secure than others.<\/p>",
            "main_text": "<p>Bezel settings are always the best bet because the stone is protected all the way around. Prong settings tend to be less secure since they only partially cover the stone and protrude outwards from the jewelry. That said, the more prongs the setting has, the safer your stone is. An 8-prong ring will be much more secure than a 3-prong ring. Stone shape is also a factor, though—for stone shapes with corners (emerald, marquise, princess, etc.), it’s most important to have prongs on the corners as those parts of the stone are most prone to breaking off.<\/p><p>To make sure your stones stay secure, check their settings every few weeks with these easy steps:<\/p><ol><li>Check for any twisted, open or bent prongs, chipped stones, or worn-down metal.<\/li><li>Softly tap on the stone with your fingernail. If the setting is secure, the stone won’t move.<\/li><li>Put the tip of your fingernail on the side of your stone and gently try to rock it back and forth. Again, secure stones won’t move.<\/li><li>Gently shake the jewelry close to your ear. If you hear any rattling, your setting might be worn down.<\/li><\/ol><p>If your piece has prongs instead of a bezel, be extra gentle when cleaning it! Applying too much force on the prongs can bend or damage them, which loosens the stones and puts them at greater risk of falling out. It’s best to only brush or wipe down the bottom and sides of prong settings.<\/p>",

            "bottom_text": "<p>If you see or hear anything wrong with your setting, take off your jewelry immediately.
